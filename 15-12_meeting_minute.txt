6. Friendly reminder about deadlines and work ethic:
* Please respond if you receive any announcements not only from the leader but also from other people.
* If you have a problem in your work, please tell the group so that we can help you.
* Please stay on the deadlines because we don’t have much time for deadline extensions.


If you have any problem in using GitHub please raise your problem in the group, we will try to use GitHub as much as possible because it is a required part in our final report.


Thank you.
